# `wasm-tracing`

A maintained fork of [`tracing-wasm`](https://github.com/old-storyai/tracing-wasm) that is compatible with the latest `tracing` and `wasm-bindgen` versions.

Leverage performance profiling with your browser tools with the [tracing crate](https://crates.io/crates/tracing).

Note: `wasm_tracing` uses the global JavaScript `console` and `performance` objects. It will not work in environments where one or both of these are not available, such as Node.js or Cloudflare Workers.

## Usage

For the simplest out of the box set-up, you can simply set `wasm_tracing` as your default tracing Subscriber in wasm_bindgen(start)

We have this declared in our `./src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn start() -> Result<(), JsValue> {
    // print pretty errors in wasm https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook
    // This is not needed for tracing_wasm to work, but it is a common tool for getting proper error line numbers for panics.
    console_error_panic_hook::set_once();

    // Add this line:
    wasm_tracing::set_as_global_default();

    Ok(())
}
```
