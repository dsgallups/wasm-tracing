# UNRELEASED
### Added
- Users now have the ability to use browser console methods (#25) that align with logging levels. i.e. `Level::WARN` logs will be emitted by `console.warn`. This value can be set via `WasmLayerConfig { use_console_methods }`.

### Changes
- `ConsoleConfig` has been removed. Behavior from the previous enumerations are available via the following field settings:

| Previous | New |
| --------- | ---- |
| `ConsoleConfig::NoReporting` | `WasmLayerConfig { enabled: false, ..Default::default() }` |
| `ConsoleConfig::ReportWithoutConsoleColor` | `WasmLayerConfig { color: false, ..Default::default() }` |
| `ConsoleConfig::ReportWithConsoleColor` | `WasmLayerConfig::new()` |

### Contributions
- @jtfmumm for #25!



# 2.1.0 (Auguest 4, 2025)
### Changes
* chore: update README.md and CHANGELOG.md by @dsgallups in https://github.com/dsgallups/wasm-tracing/pull/18
* chore: Update deps and lints by @dsgallups in https://github.com/dsgallups/wasm-tracing/pull/20
* fix: remove crate-type in manifest by @dsgallups in https://github.com/dsgallups/wasm-tracing/pull/21

# 2.0.0 (February 27, 2025)

### Added
- added `origin_base_url` to WasmLayerConfig (#15)
    - A URL that's prepended to origins.
    - Thanks @rksm!
- notes: the addition of `origin_base_url` implies that `WasmLayerConfig` is no longer copy.

### Changed
- `set_as_global_default_with_config` now returns a Result. This will fail if the global default is already set. This was erroneously performed in a patch version. In the future, `wasm-tracing` will adhere to semver.

### Removed
- `WASMLayerConfig` and `WASMLayer` type aliases. Use `WasmLayerConfig` and `WasmLayer`, respectively.

### Wants
- Suggestions for well-formed `tracing` analogs that could better support that functionality in this crate.
If there is a particular extension for tracing that you enjoy, or believe has a great interface (possibly like `rtt`),
please let me know!



# 1.0.1 (December 17, 2024)

### Added
- Update docs, doc links
- Add licenses to crate root
- `wasm_tracing::set_as_global_default_with_config` should not panic by default

# 1.0.0 (December 17, 2024)
## Notes

Thank y'all for bearing with me! I have not been able to find a satisfactory test reference, so I've gone ahead and manually checked different logging configuration options. More importantly, I think this crate's recording implementation is flawed from the ground up. Without overhauling literally every original aspect of `tracing-wasm`, I have opted to find a middle route. Suggestions are highly appreciated!

## Features
- Added `WasmLayerConfig::show_origin`. When disabled, this will remove the line numbers from the console.

## Breaking Changes
### WasmLayerConfig
- `WASMLayerConfigBuilder` has been removed.
  - This builder performed 1:1 logic on `WasmLayerConfig`, and was not useful. The values for `WasmLayerConfig` are now public.
- `WasmLayerConfig` now takes in a `ConsoleConfig` parameter. This replaces `WasmLayerConfig::report_logs_in_console` and `WasmLayerConfig::use_console_color`.
This removes the capability to use a console color while the console is disabled. If there is a use case for this, please let me know.

## Deprecations
- `WASMLayerConfig` has been semantically renamed to `WasmLayerConfig`. A type alias has been marked as deprecated.
- `WASMLayer` has been semantically renamed to `WasmLayer`. A type alias has been marked as deprecated.

## Niceties
- Added more documentation to the crate
- Added a single `wasm_bindgen_test` to visibly check different `WasmLayerConfig` options. This is far from ideal. I plan on expanding functionality of this crate to modify the default global recorder in the future.
